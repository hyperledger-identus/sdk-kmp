Prism Agent is a powerful and flexible library for working with decentralized identifiers on the Prism platform. Whether
you are building a decentralized application that requires secure and private identity management or working with a more
traditional system that requires reliable and resilient communication between DIDs, Prism Agent provides the tools and
features you need to do the job with ease.

## Overview

Prism Agent is a comprehensive library that combines all the Prism platform's building blocks - Apollo, Castor, Pluto,
Mercury, and Pollux - to provide a seamless experience for developers working with decentralized identifiers (DIDs) on
the Prism platform.

Prism Agent is designed to provide high-level functionality for DID management and DID communication. This includes DID
management, DIDComm mediation management, and support for various DIDComm protocols, including mediation, proof
presentation, issue credentials, and out-of-band messages.

With Prism Agent, developers can easily manage and communicate with DIDs seamlessly and efficiently. Prism Agent
provides a range of advanced features, including support for secure and private messaging using the Mercury protocol and
secure and portable data storage using the Pluto library.

Prism Agent also supports receiving messages through the mediator, allowing developers to easily manage and respond to
incoming messages securely and efficiently.
