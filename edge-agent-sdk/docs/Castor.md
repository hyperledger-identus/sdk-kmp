Castor is a powerful and flexible library for working with DIDs. Whether you are building a decentralised application or 
a more traditional system requiring secure and private identity management, Castor provides the tools and features you 
need to easily create, manage, and resolve DIDs.

## A Decentralised Identifier (DID) Library

Castor is a powerful and versatile library that provides a suite of decentralised identifier (DID) operations. It 
enables developers to create, manage, and resolve standards-based DID in a user-controlled manner. Castor is designed 
to be flexible and easy to integrate into various decentralised applications and systems.

Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs) are new identifier that allows individuals and organisations to create and manage their 
own digital identity. DIDs provide a secure, decentralised, and privacy-preserving way to authenticate and verify 
identity without relying on centralised authorities or intermediaries. Castor allows developers to leverage the power of 
DIDs by providing a simple and efficient way to create, manage, and resolve them.

Castor supports creating and resolving two types of DIDs out of the box: prism and peer.

With Castor, developers can create and manage DIDs, generate and manage their associated public and private keys, and 
resolve DIDs to retrieve related data. Castor also provides a range of advanced features, such as support for multiple 
key types and encryption methods and a flexible API for customising and extending its functionality.
